# Calendar : Shortest path and pattern identification

This project is divided into **two parts**. For a given schedule, you will need to:
  - **Find the shortest path** for a particular year between two days
  - **Identify the pattern** of a given calendar (see the 10 examples in the _Data_ folder) over several years

Of course, many elements are to be taken into account to carry out this project in particular **characterize the starting day of a year** or **check if a year is leap year or not**.

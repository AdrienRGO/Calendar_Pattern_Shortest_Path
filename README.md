# Calendar : Shortest path and pattern identification

This project is divided into **two parts**. For a given schedule, the proposed project:
  - **Finds the shortest path** for a particular year between two days (the file : distance_mini.c)
  - **Identifies the pattern** of a given calendar over several years (the file : Identification_pattern.c)

Of course, many elements are to be taken into account to carry out this project in particular characterize the starting day of a year or check if a year is leap year or not.

The csv files represent the different months from the 2021 year. They are used as pattern in which the code will retrieve all other months over several years that have the same pattern.
